/*
 * Stoatworks Labs - About window data for toolpath.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL HAND COPY, in the shape stoatworks-backend/scripts/sync-about.py
 * generates (adapted from rebate's hand copy on 2026-09-23). The
 * project is not yet registered in the website's projects.json, so the sync
 * cannot produce this file. Once it is registered the sync overwrites this
 * file; edit it there, not here.
 *
 * `guide` is empty on purpose: no user guide exists, and an empty link is left
 * out of the button list rather than shown as a button that opens a 404. The
 * facts were chosen so the button count -- and therefore the parameter count --
 * does not change when this is regenerated.
 *
 * `version` here is a fallback read from this repo's own manifest at sync
 * time. Anything with a build step injects the real one at build time and
 * overrides this.
